# Nile Circle

It is a mentorship initiative that enriches the academic understanding of STEM topics to students. The program contains activities that go in parallel with the studies for four years, **maximizing their values while maintaining the effort**.

# About

The name is inspired by the old education system having circles, like the Vienna Circle, where scholars gathered to share knowledge. The roots go back to the medieval schools where scholars offer to share their knowledge in their circles (حلقات العلم), like in Egypt and the MENA area. Back then, scholars taught the topics they prefered in their circles. As well, the students were able to study freely under as many scholars as they would like. I believe this **freedom** offers a different flavor from what the current system does. It is Nile Circle given the university name where I started this program, Nile University.

# Pillars

Initially, the students are required to adhere to some pillars. They shape the philosphy of the program:
- [Ethics](#Ethics)
- [Freedom](#Freedom)
- Quality of Work
- Science
- Wisdom
 
## Ethics
Throughout the program, every student should keep high moral standards, even **outside the circle**. If not speaking from religious and moral perspectives, they should consider it as a future investment in their character. **Trustworthy** is a very reliable asset in economics as in any other field. I believe investing in building a student character as a trustworthy through adhering to high moral standards—like **honesty**, **patience**, and others—should be considered **as crucial as the technical expertise**. Hence, in the very worst case, students should consider it from this perspective.

Considering this, **plagiarism is never allowed**. It is prohibited not only within the activies of the program, but in any other course in general. Lying does compromise not only the learning integrity but also their freedom, in my opinion, and I would like the **students to be free**. Of course, the mentors should not be judgemental, so students should consider this themselves.

## Freedom

Students need to be free. They should be able to criticize. **Anyone should be able to study any field, with high quality**. They should be able to address the questions they want. Therefore, we do our best in adhering to these standards.
